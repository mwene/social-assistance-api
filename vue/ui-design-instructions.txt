Design Enhancements
Color Scheme:
Used a vibrant blue gradient (#0288d1 to #4fc3f7) for the app bar, buttons, and active tabs, paired with a subtle cyan background (#e0f7fa to #b2ebf2) for a fresh, modern feel.

Typography:
Bold, clean fonts with custom spacing for titles (text-h5 font-weight-bold).
Consistent use of Roboto (Vuetify default) for a professional look.

Cards:
Rounded corners (rounded-xl), subtle elevation (elevation-6), and a light grey background (grey lighten-4) for depth.
Hover effect lifts cards slightly (translateY(-4px)).

Buttons:
Gradient backgrounds, rounded edges, and hover animations (lift and shadow) for interactivity.
Icons (mdi-*) enhance visual cues.

Forms:
Outlined, rounded, dense inputs with prepend icons for a sleek, minimal design.
Two-column layout in the applicant form for better organization and readability.

Tabs:
Centered, grow-style tabs with gradient backgrounds on active states.
Smooth transitions for a polished effect.

Layout:
Generous padding (pa-6, py-8) and spacing for a clean, uncluttered look.
Centered login card with a prominent shadow for focus.

Animations:
Subtle transitions on buttons, cards, and tabs for a dynamic feel without overwhelming the user.
